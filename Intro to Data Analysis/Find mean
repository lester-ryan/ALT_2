# Program to find the mean of a list of values
# Version 1

# Calculate and return the mean of all the values in L
def arithmetic_mean(L):

    # set the initial value of total to zero
    total = 0 # running total of values in L

    # Now loop over the list
    for v in L:
        total = total + v # running total

    # Divide by the total by the number of values in L
    return total/5

# PYTHON STARTS EXECUTING FROM HERE ...

# Initialise a list of values
my_list = [18, 27, 15, 13, 22]
# Call the function
my_mean = arithmetic_mean(my_list)
# Display the answer
print("The mean is ", my_mean)

# Check that the program is working (i.e. actual result Vs expected result)
# Change the values in the list and see what happens
# What happens if there were more (or less) than 5 values in the list?
# Does this program work for a list of strings (e.g. ["Mary", "Andy", "Pat"])? Why/why not?
